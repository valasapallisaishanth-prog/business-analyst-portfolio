📌 Key Insights Summary

- The overall churn rate is 26.58%.
- Customers with higher monthly charges show a higher probability of churn.
- Customers with low tenure (new customers) churn more frequently compared to long-term customers.
- Internet service type shows a relationship with churn — Fiber optic users churn more than DSL users.
- The machine learning model achieved an accuracy of 78.25%, meaning it can reliably identify potential churn customers.

In conclusion, churn is influenced by price sensitivity, length of relationship, and type of service.

Recommendations

📌 Business Recommendations

1. Introduce loyalty benefits for new customers to reduce early churn.
2. Provide targeted discounts for high-monthly-charge customers identified as high risk.
3. Improve service experience for fiber-optic customers to reduce dissatisfaction.
4. Implement proactive outreach before contract end dates for high-risk customers.
5. Use the churn prediction model to launch personalized retention campaigns.

These actions will significantly lower churn and improve customer lifetime value.
